# 🚀 Day 1/90: My Linux & Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Today marks the beginning of my 90-day challenge to master Linux for cybersecurity! 💻🔐

## 📅 Day 1 - Linux Fundamentals: Navigation Commands

Started with the basics - learning how to navigate the Linux file system. Here are the essential commands I practiced today:

### Navigation Commands:

```bash
pwd                 # Print working directory
ls                  # List files
ls -la              # List all files with details
cd /path/to/dir     # Change directory
cd ..               # Go up one directory
cd ~                # Go to home directory
clear               # Clear the terminal screen
```
